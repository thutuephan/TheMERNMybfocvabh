  ## Description
    Given starter code with a fully functioning Goodle Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, I need to refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
